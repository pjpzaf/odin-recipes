            <p>This is a sample chicken carbonara recipe from some random user in allrecipes.com. 
                Personally, I haven't tried this yet (I don't cook, I code! ;)). But it looks good on the picture so that is why I am putting it here! If you know of a better recipe 
                than this one, by all means, email it to me (paolojosemari.zafra@gmail.com) so that I can take a look at it (Again, that is all I can do as I don't cook. I code).</p>
